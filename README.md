# DynamicPareto

Python class for constructing a Pareto front.

In multi-objective optimization problems the corresponding single-objective
optima do not, in general, coincide. In other words, no solution exists that
can simultaneously optimize all variables, and thus a trade-off has to be
found. This type of problems can be addressed by constructing a "Pareto front".
